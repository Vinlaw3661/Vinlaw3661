## Hi there 👋, I'm Vinlaw 

My name is Vinlaw, and I'm passionate about entrepreneurship, AI, and technology, with a drive to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact. I also love exploring the power of writing as a creative exploration but also to share ideas and inspire change. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinlaw-mudehwe/) and [Website](https://www.vinlawmudehwe.com). 

### Recent Projects I Have Worked On

Face2Body 😀➡️🧍‍♀️:
I came up with an algorithm called Bounded Manhattan Assignment to map facial features to body landmarks. This idea allowed me to explore computer vision and the use of GPUs for optimization.

Hippo-ID 🦛:
I worked on a zero-shot facial recognition and identification engine that performs inference in real-time. It was fun to integrate tools like MediaPipe, DeepFace, and ChromaDB to make it work.

Malnutrition Diagnostics App 🥗:
I built an app to diagnose malnutrition, plan diets, profile nutrients, and generate medical reports. It combines anthropometric measurements, DRI recommendations, and local food data to offer practical insights. The system is developed for a startup that I cofounded whose mission is to use precision nutrition analytics to help parents and health professionals combat malnutrition especially in underprivileged communities. More can be found on the official [NouraSense website](https://www.nourasense.com/).

Scrape24 🕵️‍♂️:
I created a scraper to highlight vulnerabilities in Property24 by extracting real estate agent information. It was an interesting exploration into web scraping and the ethical implications of data usage.

Reverse API for USDA DRI Calculator 🔄:
I designed a reverse API to interact with the USDA's Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) calculator. This project let me dive into API integrations and understand how such systems work.

My main area of technical interest is AI/ML. I like to leverage these technologies to solve practical problems. I also enjoy implementing some higher level theoretical topics from my math classes into the projects I build. A recent implementation of this knowledge is an algorithm I developed called Bounded Manhattan Assignment for matching detected faces to their respective detected bodies using bounding boxes and pose landmarks.
